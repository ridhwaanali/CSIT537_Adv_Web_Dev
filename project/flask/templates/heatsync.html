        <h4>A CPU Heat sync is the fan that sits on top of the CPU.</h4>
        <h4>Its purpose is to exhaust the heat generated from the CPU when it is used</h4>
        <h4>The way it is structured is there is a metal plate to sit on top of the CPU, (most likley Copper), and it condenses the heat through the metal plate out with a fan </h4>
        <h4>Modern computers use air heat syncs and liquid heat syncs</h4>
        <h4>Air heat syncs just use the metal plate and fan to exhaust heat whereas the liquid heat sync uses a liquid cooling to push out the heat quicker</h4>
        <h4>The heat syncs usually are held with clamps located at the back of the motherboard and fans are connected on the "cpu fan header"</h4>
        <h4>Note not all CPU fans function with all CPUs please check compatability</h4>
